Update MS Access with Python

This is my first "public" respository, and contains a file to enable updating a MS Access table via Python.

Learned this from a couple of different videos available on YouTube, and a lot of trial & error. 

Required download & installation of MS Access 2013 Runtime (download from Microsoft) at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=39358.
