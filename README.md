Update MS Access with Python

This is my first "public" respository, and contains a file to enable updating a MS Access table via Python.

Learned this from a couple of different videos available on YouTube, and a lot of trial & error. 

The primary YouTube video is linked here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpHn_fMi0-o

This is a video by "Sean MacKenzie Data Analytics" & the YouTube channel is: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXeR_0JbNuPLDTr8iAo6SHg
